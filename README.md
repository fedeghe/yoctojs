# YoctoJs

A light weight DOM utility library.

## Try it

Fork me and run
``` 
> yarn buildev
```

then navigate to the example at http://127.0.0.1:3001  
tune the code in the example (or the core) to see it live.

## documentation (wip)

### function Y

Y is the main function to be used as selector / constructor
``` js
var b = Y('body p') // get all paragraphs in the body (wrapped in Y)
var myNode = Y('<span>New paragraph</span>') // creates a span tag (also wrapped in Y)
```
